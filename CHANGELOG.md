## 0.2.0
- Added notes. You can create a note for each horse. Empty notes are ignored in printouts. 
- Racecards are now saved in a Sqlite database in the Racecards directory with the filenames "railbreaker.db*"
- Added some new UI elements to support the changes for Sqlite and added more consistent coloring to the dialog boxes.
- NOTE: If you've used a version previous to 0.2.0, you can delete any *.json files in the Racecards directory.
## 0.1.2 
- The app will no longer unzip or load a racecard that's already in memory.
- I've reduced the line height for printouts to conserve on paper.
