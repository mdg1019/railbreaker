## 0.1.3
- Added notes. You can create a note for each horse. Empty notes are ignored in printouts. The filename for the note files will be something like OPX0103.notes in the Racecards directory.
## 0.1.2 
- The app will no longer unzip or load a racecard that's already in memory.
- I've reduced the line height for printouts to conserve on paper.
