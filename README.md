# RailBreaker

Is a Rust/Tauri app for handicapping horse races. It uses the single-file data files from Brisnet.

Please remember that the main purpose of the app is to be used while betting from home or wherever your laptop will go. So printouts aren't a huge priority, but I will get to those eventually. You can use Brisnet's Custom PP Generator in the meantime.

#### Railbreaker can do this at present:

- Unzip and load a racecard file.
- Load a previously unzipped racecard file.
- Load multiple racecards. (Racecard selection is changed in the sliding-left menu.)
- Partial display of racecard info. (Where I'm at now.)
- App is responsive. It may need tweaking when I complete the racecard. I'll probably set a minimum width for the app so the display stays legible.

#### Things to do:

- Allow creating and editing notes for the races and the horses.
- Do analysis of the racecard data and see what's useful to know.
- Useful highlighting of the racecard info.
- Provide printouts of racecards.
